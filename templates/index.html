This site uses a Python backend.<br/>
<br/>
With Python I'm able to run a few calls to the OS to see how Heroku does things behind the scenes.<br/>
<br/>
From my interpretation of Heroku's documentation, the Heroku dyno running free hosting will stop running this app for at least 6 hours every 24 hours. If it has been at least 6 hours since the last request to the site, the application dies. If it has been running for 18 hours, the application will kill itself and not respond to requests for 6 hours. What this means is that the application initalization time listed below will never be greater than 18 hours ago.<br/>
<br/>
This application was initialized at {{start_time}} UTC<br/>
The current time is {{now}} UTC<br/>
The operating system name is {{os_name}}<br/>
The platform is {{platform_system}}<br/>
The release is {{platform_release}}<br/>
The cpu count is {{cpu_count}}<br/>
{#
  Heroku probably doesn't want me listing the directory structure. It's not very interesting anyway.
  The directory structure is as follows:<br/>
  <br/>
  {{ directory_structure }}<br/>
  <br/>
  {%- for key, value in directory_structure.items() recursive %}                       
    <li>{{ key }}                                                             
      {%- if value %}                                                         
        Recursive {{ key }}, {{value}}                                        
        {% if value %}
          <ul>{{ loop(value.items())}}</ul>                                     
        {% endif %}
      {%- endif %}                                                            
    </li>                                                                     
  {%- endfor %}
